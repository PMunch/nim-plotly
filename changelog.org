* v0.3.3
- add ~hideLine~ for ~Trace~ object for scatter plots, in order to set
  the line width to 0. Used for backwards compatibility, because
  setting a value of 0 would be the default.
- add ~FillMode~ value of ~toSelf~ to allow colored bands / filled
  polygons
- add example for a manual error band    
* v0.3.2
- fix behavior of =show= when =--threads:on= for =Grid= usage, in
  particular for example 18. =filename= argument is now optional,
  implying just viewing a plot when none given instead of saving.
* v0.3.1
- fix link to docs in the README
* v0.3.0
- =nim-plotly= now lives under the SciNim organization
- adds option for auto resizing of plots (=autoResize= argument to
  =show/saveImage=); #72
- temporary HTML files of plotly are now not removed by default
  (=removeTempFiles= argument to =show/saveImage=); #72
- temporary HTML files are stored in a =nim_plotly= subdirectory and
  the file names are generated based on a timestamp; #72
